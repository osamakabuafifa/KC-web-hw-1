   <b><p style="font-style:italic;">Described as "soccer, but with rocket-powered cars", Rocket League has up to eight players assigned to each of the two teams,<br> using rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and score points over the course of a match.<br> The game includes single-player and multiplayer modes that can be played both locally and online, including cross-platform play between all versions.<br> Later updates for the game enabled the ability to modify core rules and added new game modes, including ones based on ice hockey and basketball.</p></b>
